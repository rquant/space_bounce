<h2>CreateJS is the Flash of HTML5</h2>
<p>
    createjs is a set of rich javascript libraries giving developers a robust
    toolset to create rich interactive experiences akin to Adobe Flash. It
    provides a great way to create complex vector grapics, tweening motions,
    sound processing, and more. It integrates really well with the HTML5 canvas
    to allow designing interactive content to be as smooth as possible. The
    best part is it is well documented and completely free, making it a great
    choice for my primary framework.
    <br><br>
    Let's take a look at at an example of how I used createjs in Space Bounce.
    My player object is an astronaut inside a simple space capsule. The space
    capsule is a spherical object with an orange window in the center. This ends
    up simply being two circles layered on to one another. Provided the HTML5
    canvas is already setup (plenty of tutorials for this on the web) this can
    be accomplished in a few lines of code using createjs.
</p>
<pre>
  var stage = new createjs.Stage("canvasId"); //set's up main stage in which everything will be added to
  var player = new createjs.Container(); //the container object used to hold the two circles together
  var capsule = new createjs.Shape();
  capsule.graphics.beginFill("white").drawCircle(0, 0, 35).endFill(); //creates the player capsule with radius of 35
  var port = new createjs.Shape(); //the window port
  port.graphics.beginFill("orange").drawCircle(0, 0, 35/3).endFill(); //creates the port the third of the capsule radius
  player.addChild(capsule, port); //first adds the capsule circle, then the port circle on top of it to create a unified object
  stage.addChild(player); //add the player to the stage
  stage.update(); //repaints the stage with its new state
</pre>
<canvas id="createjs_demo_c1" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
<p>
    As you can see it is quite simple to get going. Let's take a look at another
    example. The tweening library can allow for simple animations. In the game
    the energy orb bounces in to nothing when the player contacts and absorbs
    it. This can be accomplished with one line of code. The energy orb shape is
    created as a shape using the same steps as above.
</p>
<pre>
  createjs.Tween.get(energyOrb, {loop: true}) //add the energy orb to the tween instance, set it to loop indefinitely
     .to({scaleX: 0, scaleY: 0}, 1000, createjs.Ease.bounceIn) //change the scale to 0 over a period of 1 second. Use bounceIn effect
        .to({scaleX: 1, scaleY: 1}); //return it back to original state
</pre>
<canvas id="createjs_demo_c2" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
<p>
  There is much more to these amazing libraries, but this gives an idea of how simple and powerful it really is. Flash developers may find
  a transition into the world of HTML5 to be quite comfortable.

  c2.update();

  createjs.Tween.get(energyOrb, {loop: true}).to({scaleX: 0, scaleY: 0}, 1000, createjs.Ease.bounceIn).to({scaleX: 1, scaleY: 1});
  createjs.Ticker.setFPS(20);
  createjs.Ticker.addEventListener("tick", c2);
