<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	Space bounce is a simple but novel new arcade game, defined by the use of realtime 2D
	physics. It provides a new type of gameplay for players looking for a quick
	and
	casual pick-up-and-play experience. The projet is currently in a rudimentary
	state however and is more of a demo than a complete game.
	I plan on adding more depth such as level progression to make it more complete.
	<br><br>
	More importantly however this project was created to demonstrate the power
	and ease HTML5 and Javascript bring to aspiring web developers
	and designers. Developed using the Box2DWeb physics library and the
	feauture rich CreateJS library suite (both open source and well supported),
	Space Bounce shows web developers can build a slick interactive
	experience using Javascript without needing to learn
	an entirely new platform such as Unity.
